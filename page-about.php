<p>Welcome to Cannabis Healing, a source of information on cannabis oils, their extracts and their various uses.</p>
<p>We believe that cannabis has tremendous medicinal potential when used correctly and in accordance with the most up to date science.</p>
<p>After decades of illegality and public misinformation around the nature and effects of cannabis use, there is growing global scientific consent that the cannabis plant appears to have the potential for much greater good than harm.</p>
<p>It could offer natural, affordable relief to those suffering from a variety of ills, ranging from depression and anxiety disorders to chronic pain and even cancer.</p>
<p>Our aim is to help those who think they may benefit from further investigation get the right information and to help them get the right kind of cannabis product.</p>
