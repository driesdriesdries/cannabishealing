Traditional means of communication are currently being used to facilitate contact between our users and our sales representatives. Oftentimes, end users ask the same questions which the clerk might have answered many times before. In order to mitigate wasted time, we should investigate making use of automated responses to general queries. Implementing an element of AI in the form of a chat bot, would potentially give us an opportunity to lower the amount of sales representatives required. In order to assess the viability of this, one could run polls on the customer facing platform to gauge interest as well as data to assess general opinion.
