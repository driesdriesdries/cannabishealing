            <p>As with everything in life, there may be some risks involved to using cannabis products.

However, the two main questions when discussing cannabis products are obviously addiction 

and overdose.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I overdose on cannabis products?</strong></p>

            <p>No. The toxicity levels of cannabis, whether smoked or taken in one of its extracted forms, is so

low that an overdose is physiologically impossible.  In order to overdose on cannabis products, 

one has to ingest 40,000 times more than your body has receptors for. In other words, there are 

not enough cannabinoid receptors in your body to take in the amount necessary for an 

overdose. According to all scientific evidence, there has never been a reported case of death 

that can be attributed to the use of cannabis products alone. It is impossible to overdose on any 

cannabis product.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I become addicted to cannabis products?</strong></p>
            <p>No. Nothing in naturally grown cannabis is physically addiction-forming. This means that it is

impossible to become physically addicted to cannabis like you would to alcohol, cigarettes or 

other drugs. Frequent and heavy use can, however, become habit-forming and users may 

become psychologically dependent on one or more of the effects of its use. However, since the 

side-effects of even the heaviest cannabis withdrawal are so insignificant (mild sleep loss, 

moodiness, a sense of boredom) and overcome in such a short timespan (days for most users, 

weeks for the heaviest users), cannabis products do not pose any serious risks of addiction.</p>

              Not unless you want to, and only from specific products. THC, when taken in large enough

doses, does cause the psycho-active effect of being ‘high’, but THC is not present in all oils and 

extracts. For instance CBD, THC-A and CBN does not have a psycho-active effect. Therefore, only compounds containing THC will 

get you high, and then only if taken in large quantities, which we do not recommend for all 

cases.

            <p>According to the majority of scientific evidence, no clear links have been drawn between

cannabis use and serious medical conditions. Some evidence does, however, suggest two 

potential dangers. Since the use of cannabis elevates the heart rate for up to an hour after use, 

those with pre-existing heart conditions may increase their chances of having some kind of 

heart-related difficulties. In those of middle-age the increased risk is roughly equivalent to that 

found after making love. In older users, and especially those with serious heart conditions, this 

risk could be greater.</p>
<p>Another potential risk is the exacerbation of pre-existing psychological conditions. Since

cannabis has psychoactive ingredients, specifically THC, those who have a history of mental 

disorders or other psychological conditions may be triggered by the ingestion of cannabis. The 

side effects are mostly short-lived however, and most side effects fade within hours. Still, 

caution is advised to those who suffer from psychological conditions.</p>

            Recently, cannabis has been regulated as a schedule 6 drug in South Africa by the MCC and has been legalized for medicinal purposes.

In a landmark ruling on March 31st 2017, the Western Cape High Court ruled that it is an infringement to ban the
             use of cannabis by adults in their own homes.

This decision allows for the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis at home, for private use.
             Furthermore, CBD oil complies with South African regulations since it contains 0% THC.

          <div class="panel-body"><p>In the 1980s it was discovered that mammals (including humans) have specific cannabinoid

receptors, which are microscopic chemical structures capable of receiving and processing 

cannabinoid substances. Endocannabinoids (cannabinoids produced in the body) and their 

receptors are found throughout the body, embedded in cell membranes of the brain, organs, 

connective tissues, glands, and immune cells. Two receptors have been identified so far:</p>
            <li>CB1, predominantly present in the nervous system, connective tissues, gonads, glands,

and organs;</li>
            <li>
              CB2, predominantly found in the immune system and its associated structures.
            </li>
            <p style="margin-top:10px;">When these receptors are stimulated, a wide variety of physiological processes are catalyzed.

In each kind of tissue, the cannabinoid system performs different functions, but the goal is 

always the same: homeostasis. This means that cannabinoids in the body are responsible for 

the maintenance of a stable internal environment despite fluctuations in the external 

environment.</p>

ingredient has been at the forefront of many exciting scientific studies that investigated its range 

of effects and applications. CBD appears to have a high degree of medicinal value and it is not 

psychoactive at all – in other words, it’s impossible to get ‘high’ from usage.</p>
<p>Scientific and clinical studies indicate that CBD could be effective in easing symptoms of a wide

range of conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, PTSD, Rheumatoid arthritis and several 

neurological disorders. CBD has demonstrated neuroprotective effects, and its cancer-

suppressing potential is currently being explored at several academic research centres around 

the world. CBD is both anti-proliferative (slowing the spread of cancer cells) and tumor-reducing, 

whilst at the same time having analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiolytic effects. This is 

essential in cancer treatment for pain, inflammation and anxiety.</p>

            <p>As global attitudes towards cannabis shift, more people are looking for high quality medical

grade cannabis oil in South Africa for any number of reasons. The boy of evidence pointing to 

significant medical benefits is growing, and news is spreading by word of mouth. There are very 

few suppliers in the country that really have the required expertise or knowledge to deliver the 

best highest quality products and informed usage prescriptions.</p>
            
            <p>Our suppliers use state of the art equipment and methods to ensure the medical-grade quality of

our cannabinoid products. Through a solvent-free method of C02 extraction, the desired 

cannabinoids are removed from the cannabis plants to ensure that no unwanted material ends 

up in our final product. As a result, ours is one of the purest and most potent products found on 

the South African market.</p>

            <p>Please note! Never make use of oil that looks like “black tar”, which means it has been

produced with butane, hence the black colour and texture. Patients who make use of cannabis 

for medical purposes, already have compromised systems, so the black stuff really isn’t healthy. 

They should not add any extra stress to their bodies by consuming a low quality and inferior 

product.</p>

                Prices of medical cannabis oil in South Africa do vary, but if you are purchasing the genuine

product then prices should be comparable. The price of cannabis oil is directly related to the 

amount of raw cannabis required to produce the desired amount of cannabis oil. It 

takes 10 grams of raw high-grade cannabis to produce 1ml of high-quality cannabis oil. 

Currently 1 gram of high-grade cannabis sells for R150, which means that 10ml of the extract 

should cost around R1000 – R1500. It should be noted that 10ml of the extract should contain 

roughly 400+ drops and should last between one and three months, depending on the dosage required.

              Cannabis Healing has access to a selection of cannabis oil products (CBD, THC, THCA and CBN) which

are used to treat various ailments and conditions. We provide information on the correct dosage 

for each ailment or illness on a case-by-case basis to ensure you get the right product and dose 

for you.
            </p>
            <p>For most conditions, Cannabis Healing suggests using tinctures, which allows for micro-dosing,

a process whereby small amounts are ingested as necessary, without causing any psychotropic 

side-effects. Each drop of tincture contains 2mg of oil concentrate (10% or 1000mg of the 

amount in a 12ml glass dropper top bottle). Tinctures contain no alcohol and are safe for 

children and animals if used according to prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Storage of cannabis oils:</strong> Storage of cannabis oils: CO2 extracted cannabis oils are best kept in the refrigerator when it is not being used. If that is not possible, store
 in a cool, dry and dark place. The oils have a shelf life of several years. With oils using coconut oil as a carrier fluid, 
  best storage would be at room temperature. Coconut oil will change to a thick consistency in cold temperatures
  , to change it back to normal consistency, simply place the tincture in a cup of warm water for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong>Directions for use:</strong>When dosing using a tincture, do not dilute in water or juice. It is easiest to dispense the drops

in a teaspoon or directly in the mouth. Keep the drops on or under the tongue for roughly a 

minute before swallowing. If the taste is unpleasant, it can be taken with honey to the same 

effect.</p>
